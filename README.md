## XRay Glasses
Inside This Repository -- We Will See Into The Code...and Find the Evil

### History
This Idea Was Not Mine, But The Implemntation Will Be. If the person who's idea this was would like credit I'd be happy to give it to him, but he has verbosly requested that he 1) not be given any, and 2) this work be free of restriction. 

The Idea being heuristic, visual, detection of packing methods utilized in advanced exploit laiden files and malware.

## Usage

```
xray.py path/to/file.exe 

python xray.py ../pathtobadness/malcode.danger 
[+] XRay Codeimage complete: malcode___IMAGE.bmp

```

## Output

Clearly visibile is the encoded payload, as evidenced by the nullspace displaying a gradient pattern:

Created from this exploit laden word doc containing a malcious back door: E4B98573EB8E9EFBA28FEAABCF915600160E36EF3D8C40DA5E716E0A5EAEE6CD (Available on VirusTotal).
